The PayPal Core SDK for .NET
----------------------------
*	The PayPal Core SDK is used to call the PayPal Platform API Web Service for the given payload and PayPal API profile settings.

*	The PayPal Core SDK addresses the essential needs of the PayPal API caller:
 	Frequent and up-to-date releases: The PayPal Core SDK is available on NuGet, which translates as immediate SDK refreshes upon updates to PayPal APIs.
 	Simpler configuration: A single configuration file that lets you manage your API credentials (supports multiple credentials), connectivity details, and service endpoints.
 	Error log: The PayPal Core SDK uses the log4net tool to log output statements to a text file to help locate the problem.
 	Backward compatibility: The PayPal Core SDK is developed using .NET Framework 2.0 and should compile on later versions of the .NET Framework.

NuGet 2.2
---------
*	NuGet is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to add, remove, and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio projects that use the .NET Framework. 
*   If you develop a library or tool that you want to share with other developers, you create a NuGet package and store the package in a NuGet repository. 
*   If you want to use a library or tool that someone else has developed, you retrieve the package from the repository and install it in your Visual Studio project or solution. 
	When you install the package, NuGet copies files to your solution and automatically makes whatever changes are needed, such as adding references and changing your app.config or web.config file. 
*   If you decide to remove the library, NuGet removes files and reverses whatever changes it made in your project so that no clutter is left.
